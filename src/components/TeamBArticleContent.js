            <p>Mahatma Gandhi once said, “The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.”</p>

            <p>Our members from External Team B are certainly putting this principle into practice – they are the geniuses behind Gift For Good, a donations-in-kind platform connecting individual and corporate donors to NPOs in Singapore. Led by Marcus, Jing Wen, and Jing Ying, Gift For Good also envisions to galvanise a more generous Singapore and support low-income families by facilitating access to basic necessities. Team members Daniel, James, Roxanne, and Qin-Liang also play a pivotal role in this project.</p>

            <p className="margin-bottom-medium"><b>But how is this done?</b></p>

            <p>Through this platform, anyone can be of great help – all they have to do is register an account and they can start donating items or responding to wish lists. Afterwards, they can chat with a social worker to arrange for delivery. Who knew that helping others is that simple?</p>

            <ol className="team-article__list margin-bottom-medium">
                <p>Furthermore, this group of brilliant undergraduates with a passion for helping the less fortunate in Singapore designed this online platform with the following features:</p>
                <li><b>Carousell-like experience</b> for a more seamless user experience </li>
                <li><b>Matching of wishes and donations</b> in order to meet the immediate needs of low-incomed families</li>
                <li><b>Chat feature with delivery scheduling</b> for ease of communication between parties</li>
            </ol>

            <p>What really inspired them to embark on this project is the urgent and critical issue of poverty in Singapore. While the country is known for its well-developed infrastructure and high growth rates, these benefits are not distributed equally. It was even found that the bottom 20% of households in Singapore are unable to make ends meet on their own, and as such platforms like Gift For Good can really make a huge difference in their lives.</p>

            <p>The team strongly believes that giving can go beyond cash donations, and hence donations-in-kind can be extremely valuable to meet pressing needs of NPOs and beneficiaries. This is especially relevant now, where many people face unemployment or pay cuts. Facilitating DIK is a humble way to help these individuals tide over tougher times.</p>

            <p>But of course, the road ahead them is not all smooth sailing. The team cites that one key challenge would be to design features of the website to ensure a seamless user experience. To address this, the team has engaged several NPOs to understand more about how they currently obtain in-kind donations to help their beneficiaries. Drawing on the experience and knowledge of other NPOs could possibly boost Gift For Good’s effectiveness and success.</p>

            <p>Therefore, with such passionate and skilful members in the team, it is certain that Gift For Good will continue to positively impact the community. </p>
