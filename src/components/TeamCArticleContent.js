            <p>Last but not least we have <b>External Team C</b> directed by two team heads Johanna and Klement and their team members Amelia, Eugene, Rachel, Colin, Sherman, Peirong and Anisha!</p>

            <p>With Singapore being heavily focused on meritocracy, whereby people are evaluated based on their academic achievements, some groups have greater advantage than others. Often, this hinders the marginalised from achieving social mobility to enjoy a better quality of life. In fact, our compassionate leader, Johanna saw this gap in our society where underprivileged youths faced difficulties in attaining social mobility as crucial to address. Many of them have limited options in their career path and settle for low-paying jobs that may prevent them from climbing the socioeconomic ladder.</p>

            <p>Therefore, the team believes that everyone should have equal access to opportunities so that they can lead a fulfilling life on their own accord. Team C has decided to work on a project that targets underprivileged youths to ensure that they have equal access to career opportunities and can achieve social mobility, named “Vantage SG”.</p>

            <p className="margin-bottom-medium">“Vantage SG” is an intuitive career readiness platform for youths between 16 to 24 years old.</p>

            <ol className="team-article__list margin-bottom-medium">
                <p>The website provides a simple way for youths to craft their resume right from the beginning. What is so special about Vantage is that it has 3 unique features to guide youths. These features are:</p>
                <li><b>Bitesize Questions</b> in typeform format to guide youths to create their professional resume through step by step questions making it simple and easy for them.</li>
                <li><b>Speech-to-Text Option</b> to ease the process of building their resume without having to type out their resume manually.</li>
                <li><b>Multimedia Alternative</b> for youths who find it easier to express themselves through video format resume as compared to a written resume.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>All these features provide the essential steps in paving the way for the youths’ careers and their future. The team also adopted the NLP neuro linguistic programming to ensure that youths who are new to building their resume can go through a guided process to hone their personal development skills.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, Vantage SG is not without challenges. Team C foresees that one of the potential problems they might face include attracting users and onboarding them onto Vantage SG. Hence, Team C is currently actively looking for organisations to partner with and gain as much exposure and awareness to widen its reach. The team is currently in partnership with CareerSocius, Access, Shine, Hatch and NUS Centre for Future-Ready Graduates who made this journey possible!</p>

            <p>If you know of someone who may be in need of this platform, feel free to introduce them to <a href="https://vantage-sg.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this website</a>. Who knows? It may help them in their career! </p>
