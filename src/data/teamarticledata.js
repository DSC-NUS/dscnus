Furthermore, parents of children with autism may sometimes feel helpless as to how to support their children in their learning journey, especially in the initial stage when they first come to know that their children have autism.",

Often, this hinders the marginalised from achieving social mobility to enjoy a better quality of life.

Many of them have limited options in their career path and settle for low-paying jobs that may prevent them from climbing the socioeconomic ladder.",
